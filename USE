Hello love,

Scraper V1 which is the first one in the files uses an "abnormal" way of scraping. It's through an API. Additionally,
it only "gets" the first 20 results.

Scraper V2 is the conventional method; however, it only reaches 5 results for now. The good thing about V2 is that it
can expand way beyond 20 results but requires a lot more code and "user" input (this is a Selenium necessity as websites
have shit like "do you want cookies" which complicates scraping and requires us to input that we don't want the cookies
before being able to access the data). V2 HAS FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES
